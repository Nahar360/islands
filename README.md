# Features

- Set program title.
- FPS shown in UI.
- Set background color of program.
- Create custom and random worlds.
- Edit worlds by adding/removing rows and colums.
- Change tile types with primary and secondary mouse clicks.
- Clear worlds.
- Save worlds to .txt files and load them back.
- Automatic live detection of islands and unique number of islands.

# TODO

- Maybe typedef for some complex types.
- Islands summary with vertical and horizontal scroll bars.
- FPS is "too quick" -> run it at fixed 60 fps.
- Long press on tile for neighbours semi-transparent overlay (green for land, red for water).
- Maximum recommended level of recursion?
- Too small on some displays (i.e. laptop display).
- Ability to create SFML window in a specific screen.
- Add unit tests using /src/worlds.
- Create a 'mouse manager' with a design pattern.
